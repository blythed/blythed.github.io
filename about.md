I'm an AI researcher, entrepreneur and architect based in Berlin Germany. I've published extensively on the topic of [machine learning and AI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-H7cJ8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), including some of the [most widely cited work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=-H7cJ8wAAAAJ&citation_for_view=-H7cJ8wAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC) in natural language processing of the last few years, made major initial contributions to the open source package [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) (now over 10,000 stars), was an initial driving force behind Zalando's [AI ramp up and NLP strategy](https://corporate.zalando.com/en/company/research-zalando), founded, bootstrapped a 2-man startup [LF1](https://lf1.io/) to 7-figure revenue within 1.5 years, and [exited](https://www.attraqt.com/resources/attraqt-acquires-ai-ip-assets-from-aleph-one/#:~:text=Thursday%20October%201%2C%202020%E2%80%A6,assets%20from%20Aleph%20One%20GmbH.) the deep-learning powered e-commerce search suite [Aleph-Search](https://www.alephsearch.com/) to the market leader in e-commerce search and navigation, [Attraqt Group PLC](https://www.attraqt.com/). 

If you are interested in working with me on a speculative project involving AI, deep-learning, natural language processing, semantic information retrieval or related areas, then please [reach out](#contact-me) with a short description of your idea and why the project is important to your company or organization.

### Projects

#### Aleph Search

[Aleph Search](https://www.alephsearch.com/) is a complete suite for e-commerce search and navigation powered end-2-end with deep-learning. Aleph Search was [acquired](https://www.attraqt.com/resources/attraqt-acquires-ai-ip-assets-from-aleph-one/#:~:text=Thursday%20October%201%2C%202020%E2%80%A6,assets%20from%20Aleph%20One%20GmbH.) by Attraqt Group PLC in 2020. I continued the journey with Attraqt in an advisory capacity until 2022, during which time Aleph Search (now Attraqt's "[AI powered search](https://www.attraqt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ai-powered-search.pdf)") was deployed to production on the websites of the major e-commerce players in Europe. Among these are:

- Adidas
- Asos
- Missguided
- Pretty Little Thing
- Screwfix
- Secret Sales
- Superdry
- Waitrose

Aleph Search comprises semantic search (search with "meaning"), similar product recommendation (search for similar "looking" products), reverse image-search (find a product using an uploaded image of worn fashion items), shop-the-look (find all items in an image containing multiple fashion items), auto-complete (suggest searches based on partial search) and product tagging (fill out missing, or additonal product information).

#### Contextual string embeddings

In a research project together with Alan Akbik and Roland Vollgraf, we demonstrated in [the first paper of its kind](https://aclanthology.org/C18-1139/?utm_campaign=piqcy&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), that pretraining a high quality language at the character level, leads to highly cost effective representations for named-entity recognition and similar sequence labelling tasks. Our analysis showed that character level language modelling combines the best of sub-word level granularity with meaningful semantic vectorial neighbourhoods for a number of downstream tasks. In languages such as German, which has a highly compositional structure from sub-word to word level, this leads to improvements over the SOTA of over 10%. The research paper was published and presented at [COLING 2018](https://coling2018.org/), and made a major contribution to the proliferation of language model representations such as [Bert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model), which form an integral part of e.g. the Google search algorithm.

#### Flair

![]({{ site.baseimg }}/images/flair.png){: width="80" }

I was an initial contributor to the [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) library, an initiative of [Alan Akbik](https://alanakbik.github.io/) (now Humboldt University) at Zalando Research. Flair is a simple but effective library for core NLP tasks, making it straightforward to deploy and combine word level embeddings for a variety of tasks, including:

- named entity recognition (NER)
- part-of-speech tagging (PoS)
- sense disambiguation
- sentence level classification

#### PADL

[Pipeline Abstractions for Deep Learning (PADL)](https://padl.ai/), codifies the approach we took to development at LF1.

#### Prediction and quantification of athletic performance

Together with [Franz Kiraly](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=VYi_04kAAAAJ&hl=de), I developed and [published a new approach](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157257) to predicting and quantifying athletic performance, based on a novel combinatorial-matrix completion algorithm.
