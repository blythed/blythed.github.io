I'm an AI researcher, entrepreneur and architect based in Berlin Germany. I received my M.Math.Phil (1st class) in Mathematics and Philosophy from Oxford University, UK in 2007,
an M.Sc in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning from the Technical University of Berlin, Germany in 2009, and a Ph.D in Computer Science (Summa cum Laude) from the Technical University of Berlin, Germany in 2015. After receiving my Ph.D, I tutored applied mathematics at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Bagamoyo, Tanzania and conducted postdoctoral research in Sach Mukherjee's Statistics and Machine Learning group at the DZNE in Bonn, Germany. In 2016 I elected to switch to industry and was involved in establishing the AI research team at Zalando Tech. At Zalando I worked on prototyping ideas for a image-based search algorithm, co-authored one of the most widely cited papers on NLP of 2018, and made some of the early founding contributions to the widely used open-source NLP library "Flair". In 2019 I co-founded the AI innovation lab LF1 GmbH. After an initial ramp-up of just 1 year and a development team of 2 people (myself and Alexander Schlegel) we developed Aleph Search, which was acquired by Attraqt Group in 2020.
